# node.js unit test examples

This is a project with some node.js unit tests. The modules that are used to check different cases are:
- chai
- mocha
- nock
- proxyquire
- rewire
- sinon
- supertest

There are examples that are stubbing private variables, stubbing and spying functions, mocking requests and mocking express routes.

Some npm tasks are defined that are very helpful to produce code coverage and lint coverage. They integrate really well with jenkins:
- tape
- eslint
- istanbul
